# News-API-app
A native Android app that uses API from newsapi.org.

When first opened, the app shows the user a list of news sources to select from. Clicking on a news source will start a new Activity 
which presents a list of news articles from that source. Clicking on any of the article will start a WebView which loads the article 
from the provided URL.
